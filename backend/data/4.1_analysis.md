---  
**I. Recurring Themes**  
  
1. **Price Concerns & Bill Increases**  
   - Many callers express frustration over sudden bill increases, expired promotions, or confusion over charges (e.g., “My bill increased by $30 this month and just increased $20 a couple months ago.”).  
   - Customers frequently compare Spectrum pricing with competitors (AT&T, T-Mobile, Circle One Cyber, Kinetic/Windstream, Google Fiber, Verizon, Frontier), often seeking price matches or discounts.  
   - Numerous calls involve customers threatening to cancel or actually canceling due to high prices, seeking retention offers or loyalty discounts.  
  
2. **Promotions, Bundles & Retention Offers**  
   - Spectrum offers many “one-year promotional rates,” often coupled with a free mobile line for a year.  
   - Agents frequently advise customers to call back before promotions expire to get new offers and avoid rate hikes.  
   - Bundling services (internet, TV, voice, mobile) is pushed as a way to save, but customers sometimes feel pressured into adding unwanted services (especially mobile lines).  
   - Some customers express frustration at having to call annually to “work the system” for the best rate.  
  
3. **Service Changes, Cancellations & Equipment Returns**  
   - Calls often relate to disconnecting or transferring service due to moves, dissatisfaction, or switching providers.  
   - There’s confusion about the process for canceling, especially regarding:

     - Overlapping billing cycles and credits  
     - Keeping existing phone numbers when switching or transferring  
   - Many calls involve service interruptions or disconnections that were not properly processed, resulting in extra charges.

5. **Mobile Service Pushback**  
   - Spectrum’s strategy of using mobile service as a lever for lower internet pricing is frequently met with resistance. Many customers are uninterested in switching mobile providers.

6. **Language & Accessibility**  
   - Some calls are conducted in Spanish or are bilingual, indicating a need for multilingual support.

   - At times, agents express confusion or frustration with internal processes, lack of information, or system limitations (e.g., inability to locate accounts, problems with system notes, unclear escalation paths).  
  
8. **Third-Party Fraud/Scams**
