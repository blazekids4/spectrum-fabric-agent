How is that been working for you as far as that that Speed? Agent: , seriously? Caller: Not great, but it that way. Sometimes it is good, sometimes it comes in and out. It all depends. Then I will like you know, so you know. Caller: Right. Caller: 7. Agent: Let me check your equipment because I know you have been with us a little over 7 years. Looks like you. Do you have the updated modem? Is this something that just because I know out of 7 years, does it just recently start kind of giving you those little hiccups or is this something that has been going on like the whole time? Agent: no. Caller: Maybe within The Last year. I know my neighbor, he has a lot of issues with his internet that you know, next to me and stuff like that. So they have been out, you know, looking the Lines and doing everything like that. So and we have a new Server coming in. It is our area, so green light. So there, you know, if I were active. So I do not know, like, you know, we will see how it is. That is why I have said that is why it made me think about the Price and stuff, you know. Caller: Right. Caller: Ok. Agent: OK, I understand'cause these new people are coming in in the town, but do not do not worry, we could definitely get you some lower prices here with Spectrum and I will check to see pretty much if we are able to get you like some faster Speed, you know like some Allure rate with some faster speeds also. Caller: It is great. Agent: So let us see. I mean, I know you have been with this for some time now. Agent: , OK. Caller: By 40 years, you know, I was actually doing it well with Time Warner. It was spectrum, I guess. So I have been with you for a Long, Long time, so. Agent: So was it just 7 years pretty much at this address, right? In particular? Caller: Yeah, I moved. Yeah, we moved. Yeah, Yeah, we moved. Agent: Got it. OK. Caller: Okay. Agent: Definitely appreciate you for your , longevity here with Spectrum. I am going to look into you , some lower rates like , what do you who do you have like for your mobile provider right now? Who is that with? Caller: The phone my daughter has got AT and T she paid the Bill, you know so. Agent: , OK. Do you know how much she they are charging her over there with A T T? Agent: OK, alright, that is a blessing. Caller: No, I do not. You know, she takes care of it so I do not worry about it yet. Well, between her and the kids and stuff like that, I guess they got a Group rate or whatever it is. So the mortar merrier, put it that way, so. Caller: I know that you know. Agent: That is definitely a blessing, you know, that you have a daughter that is even, you know, sounds like she is doing well for herself to be able to help you. I Hope my daughter. Caller: Yeah, really. Caller: Dollars. Caller: Right. Caller: Yeah. Agent: Does this good for her? So not that I need the Hell, but II mean I just would be happy. No One that that she does not like need me or call me for everything. I it would not be nice for her to kind of handle some things for me. So you that just shows you did a really good. You know a good Job with her. Caller: Thank you. Agent: So I am pulling it up here. Let is see. Agent: We do have a offer, it is for it would be an internet, a gig of Speed. Like right now you are on 600 megabit per Second. We could get you some faster Speed up in you to 1000 megabit per Second for a lower rate. We could this offer it would be for $55.00. Caller: OK. Agent: Lowering your Bill by like what, 30 Bucks and getting you some faster speeds? Agent: I could take a look. Caller: OK, Well would be the speeding up right now to 600, would there be any cheaper or they said it is? Caller: You know. Agent: 'Cause I know you are kinda I know you said that you were kinda having some hiccups or some. Agent: Lagging with it. Caller: Yeah, like it says, I know when she is at it, sometimes she did like the freezer frame or something like that and she got it, you know, and then it comes back on and stuff like that. So it is it is not a thing that like we said, we should watch the TV, we stream on TV. So it has really affected that, you know, but to serve iPad and stuff like that. So that is a lot. We notice it and stuff so. Agent: I understand. Agent: So we have a offer for 50 like if you. Caller: Yeah, OK. I put the Speed test on it and sometimes it is a Rocket that time it is the 2 spaces above the turtle, you know so it. Caller: You know so. Caller: No. Agent: , seriously, I do not know. Well, that is how I really wanted you to get like get upgraded here. But I mean, you could save $5 that if you stayed on, well, if you went on the Internet premiere, that One would be for $50.00. We could do the gig for 55. But we do, we have another offer here for the Internet premier now that One. Agent: Is just $40 for the Internet premiere. But this One, it does include a line of Spectrum mobile service which is free for a year, Unlimited talk, text, data. The regular rate is $30 a month, but it is, it is $0 a month for 12 months. So even if like if you have a phone maybe laying around that you are no longer using or something, you can activate it on our Spectrum mobile Network. It will be free for 12 months, but that will get you the $40.00. Agent: Internet Premier rate with us. Agent: It is totally, you know. Caller: Yeah. Now, OK, so what would you recommend? Which way would you recommend? But that way you know 1000 is 1000 way too much because they said the only thing I used is the TV. Caller: In my computer, in her iPad, basically what we use, you know, so. Caller: Ebay. Caller: Yeah, no, we did not understand yet. Agent: Streaming computer and iPad. I mean, it might not be, it will not hurt, you know, that is our highest Speed. So of course you know, it will not hurt. Everything will probably just be moving more fast. But honestly, I think that you you will be Fine without it. I typically always recommend it for people who have multiple devices or like Security cameras, you know, stuff like that. But I can not knock it, you know, it is definitely good to have. Caller: OK. Agent: But like, you could save, you know, 5 Bucks, you could do $50 on your Internet premier, but as I stated, if you bring over like a line of Spectrum mobile service, you could get the $40 rate bundled in with the cell phone. Agent: Yes, Internet and your Wi-fi. Caller: OK, OK. They said that is what my daughter had to talk to her about, the cell phones and stuff like that. So why do not we go with the $50.00? That is it. Strictly the Internet, right? Then that you know, Yeah. OK. All right. Agent: OK, Bear with me here. Caller: A while ago there there is this. Now there is 600 megabytes or whatever it is. 600 we are talking. Caller: Or. Agent: This One is Internet Premiere. It is going to be 500, but let me see here. I am checking your equipment, right? And I am trying to figure it out. You do not have our Wi-fi router, are you? Do you have your own Wi-fi router? Caller: I think it is yours. I am pretty curious. It is yours. Yeah, it is yours. Caller: You know. Agent: I think we I show you as having our modem, just One Piece of equipment. Agent: OK, so cool. Caller: Yeah, OK, Yeah, OK, OK. We have your motive and I got my Wi-fi. Yes, I have the the other One, yes, One blocked me One block you, so maybe that has got to be updated. Caller: Adiós. Caller: Yeah. Agent: So that is even, that is even better then because no, I just, I just assume I really did not look in your account. I just assume everybody has both of ours. But when I look, you know, when I get ready to like process it through, I am looking like, hold on, we do not have a Wi-fi router on here for him. So you with you having your own Wi-fi router, you can still get the gig then because of course I do not know if you were aware of that. Our Wi-fi router is $10.00. Caller: OK, now, yeah. Agent: So like since you do not have our router then you could get the spectrum the internet gig 450. Caller: OK, that is not good. Agent: And so you will still get the 1000 megabit per Second for the rate for 50 Bucks. Caller: OK, that sounds good. This is Jupiter. When I was paying, it is up like that in the House Force, you know, let us let us try it out and stuff like that. But yeah, definitely I try that. Caller: OK. Caller: Right. Yeah. Agent: 'Cause I mean, I noticed that you, you did, you know, mention the issues that you were having here. So that will definitely help you. But then it even saved you money, you know,'cause you do not have our router. And I could get you an even lower offer. Now it is saying your modem capacity. Let is see. Caller: OK. Agent: It is going to, it is saying that you would get a new modem. Well your, your modem capacity goes to the modem that you have. It could hold up to 940 megabit per Second. So our system is saying in order for you to pull the 1000, the full 1000 megabit per Second, we will ship you out a new modem. Caller: OK. Agent: And you can just swap it out with the current modem that you have. Caller: OK. Caller: Yeah, I would not. OK. Agent: But I mean, we are going to, the system is going to start kicking out the 1000 megabit per Second. You know, as of now, 11, I submit this, it is just saying the modem that you have, it stops at like 940 megabit per Second. So you will not pull the full gig until The New modem comes and it is installed. So it is kind of totally up to you. I could ship it out to your home. If we ship it today, you would have it tomorrow. It is no cost to you for that. Caller: OK, sounds good. Yeah, Yeah, let us try it and stuff like that, you know? Caller: OK. Agent: OK, great. So then and then that also might help you know with the issues you know that you have been dealing with, you will have your Brand new modem, some faster speeds and then that should help out and I can go ahead and get this. Agent: Yes, yes, sorry. You could return it to your local spectrum. Caller: OK. And I think the Old modem, I can drive it off at the Spectrum Store. OK, I can do that for us. I know where that is. Caller: Y. Agent: So I submit this through for today is day. So the rate, so the $50 rate, it kicks in on your next Bill cycle. I think this One is already printed up and everything up. Darn couple more day. Like even if you would have called us Last week, we would have caught it before this Bill. Agent: Got printed so it would. It will update for your Bill your due date for October. It will start for just the $50 a month. Agent: But we are going to send in, , you will start receiving the faster speeds as of right now. Caller: Right. That is Fine. You know, it is OK. It has got to be better than what I got now or you know, so you can not hear what I got. It is not left out, you know, it is not a problem. Caller: Ok. Caller: OK, that is. Caller: The radiator was up. Agent: Yeah, and this the rate will be good for the next 12 months. So for a year it would expire September 2026. So the key thing is to just be sure to follow-up with us this time next year. So that way we could put another promo on here for you, you know, just to make sure that you are you are getting the lowest rate. I know you were paying $85.00, which is Fine. You know, that is our quote on quote our standard rate. But with you being with us so Long, I mean you should never be paying. Caller: Right. Agent: You should always, you know each year call in and get your promotion. Caller: Well, you always got to this. They always got to this down for The New people, put the Family, you know, whatever the Old people and stop. You understand? Caller: Right. Caller: De noticias. Caller: Ok.

Agent: Hello, this is Deanna with Spectrum in Kansas. Is this Miss Elliott? Caller: She is here, yes. Agent: Hello, How are you? California. You said she is here. Can I speak to her, please? Caller: I am here. Caller: Hello. Agent: Hello, Miss. Hello, Miss Elliot, This is Deanna with Spectrum in Kansas. How are you? Caller: A. Agent: The previous representative explained to me that you are calling in to remove service. Caller: No, not calling to remove my friend is helping me. Let me give you my phone, her phone back to her. Agent: OK. Caller: Yes, madam. So as i explained to him, we are just kind of looking at the options here. Her current, her current phone line is on a copper line and those are starting to be phased out in our area. And so the Company that she has the copper line through is offering her to switch to fiber. Caller: And so therefore, when her phones switched to fiber, that also includes internet. Caller: And so all we are looking at right now is what her spectrum Bill is going to look like if she got rid of that internet and also just a couple other things here like what is a spectrum TV enhancement and and removing that internet. Agent: OK. Caller: But we are not doing it today. This is just informational gathering purposes. Agent: Yes, madam, I can help you with that. Agent: , it looks like she has our Spectrum TV select. Agent: Is she using her free streaming apps with that service? Caller: Do you stream anything? Like do you watch anything that is not on cable? No, no. Agent: OK. Agent: What channels do she like watching? Caller: I watched Channel 3 on the 5. Caller: xxx. Agent: 4673. Caller: 14. Agent: And 14 and that sounds like half of those are locals, OK and. Caller: Yeah, but most of them are. Agent: You say xxx and 14 is that? Caller: ¿Saber quién? Agent: You said 10 channel 5, channel 4673 and 1414. Caller: That is all I can think of right now. Agent: OK, keep in mind with your current package you get free streaming out. So you get up to $50 Worth of free streaming outs. You get Disney, Peacock, Paramount, Max, AMC and VIX for free. Caller: I am sure she does not use any of those, madam. Agent: OK, so it comes with her service that she currently has. If she want to start using it, she will login with her spectrum e-mail and password. Caller: Do you by chance have that information Spectrum password, not your 4 digit code like your e-mail and login? Agent: No problem. Caller: No, she does not even have that, madam. Agent: OK, well if she do not, she can create an account online to get that information. If she goes to, how do she sign into her Bill app? Agent: Or her TV app. Caller: She does not. She pays over the phone. Caller: Ya está ahí actually. Caller: Right. Agent: OK, no problem. We we can get into that and then it looks like she has spectrum internet with us. How many devices do she have connected to her Wi-fi and what kind? Caller: The only thing you have connected to the internet is your desktop computer. That is it. Agent: OK, no Smart TV is. Caller: Smart TV No. Agent: All right, Bear with me. Caller: Ajá. Agent: And I do not see that she has spectrum Voice. What is she doing for her landlord service? Caller: So that that is the bright Speed. Agent: OK, how much is she paying for bright Speed? Caller: Well, the thing is, they are they are a copper line. So we are switching. We are discussing the options of switching to fiber, and they are offering her free installation for $29 a month for a year. Agent: OK. You said $29.00. Caller: Yes, madam. Agent: And you said they have copper Lines? Caller: No, no, they are switching from copper to fiber. Agent: OK. Agent: OK, so let me take a look at. Agent: Her account to see what we can do now to go over everything. What I am going to do is pull up a statement. Do you have your statement in front of you? Caller: We do. Agent: Are you looking at September 3rd? What statement are you looking at? Caller: We Yes madam, we have that One right here. Agent: OK, so I am reviewing Page 2 if you have that in front of you. Agent: So right now if you look at the TV, she is getting a promotion discount of $47 for having her service bundle with Spectrum. When you bundle more, you save more and then for the internet, she is getting a $10 promotion discount. So if we was to remove service, that can cause the TV to lose that promotion discount of 4701. Agent: So it will increase to roughly $47.01. So you will go from $107 to if we round everything off. Agent: One Second, let us see your parent right now 10799. Caller: Right, OK. Agent: Plus $47.00, so you are looking at roughly 154 if we was to remove. Agent: Yep. Caller: And I do not want to enter, I do not want to interrupt you, but that is exactly what I said to the man before you. And he said, well, I have never heard of that, so that is just funny. But also, she just told you that she watches 6 channel. Agent: Right. So we are getting. Caller: And I am assuming with this package she has got 106 channel minimum. Agent: Yeah, she get 150 plus channels and then she gets $50 Worth of free streaming service. Caller: Which she needs none of that. Agent: So under there if you see under where I am reading the promotion discounts, you see the Disney HBO and I just added HBO Max. It looks like HBO Peacock, ESPN is new in Fox One and more so she get she gets all that service for free. But if she is the is she the only person in her in her household? Caller: Yes, madam. Agent: OK so if she is the only one:00 in the household I can take a look and see if we have other packages since she only watched a few channels. Agent: Now with her equipment, she has the spectrum receiver. Agent: She is paying $15 a Piece for that equipment. Do she have Smart TV is if not? Agent: We can save her some money. Fair because a lot of people use these HD receivers to get high definition. Agent: Television service. Caller: Her TV is newer, but it. Agent: So. Caller: 2 TV. Is that why I have to receive? You have a TV in the bedroom. Do you use you use both OK? Yes madam. She has 2 TV S. Agent: OK, can she download the Spectrum TV app? Caller: I mean, I mean, I can help her if she has to, but again. Caller: What would be the purpose of that? Agent: Because she is paying $30 for 2 equipments, if she want we can swap out those equipments. So we can S swap out the HD receiver which she is paying $15 apiece, which is a total of 30. We can swap it out with the Xumo box. With the Xumo box that comes preloaded with 250 streaming apps along with the Spectrum TV app. Agent: And it has a remote with a keypad too, so it is only $5.00. Caller: Ma'am, she, I understand that this is your Job and everything, but she really does not need all of that. She just needs her local channels. Agent: That is what we are getting to. Agent: So that can save her $30 there if she has a Smart TV. Agent: And then to go back to what you asked for the enhancements, her enhancements is Entertainment few where you get 80 plus channels. Caller: OK. Agent: So if she is not watching those 80 plus channels, she can remove that. Better save her $15.00. Caller: Any idea of those channels she rattled off or included in that? Agent: No madam there. She should get those in her 150 channel line up all those channels that she requested. Caller: OK. Agent: And then her internet is 100 Speed. Now you stated that bright Speed. Do they go over all the hidden fees with you? Caller: We are not there yet. We called you first. Agent: OK. Well, if Bright Speed is offering you something, keep in mind you do not have any contracts. Make sure they go over all the contracts and hidden fees. I do see I can get you down to 50. So right now you are paying 5999. We can get you lower than that. Agent: If you want to keep your service with us. Agent: OK. Caller: OK. But the problem is the fiber phone line that so she already has an account with bright Speed because that is who her copper line telephone is with. So the the the Company is not changing, it is just in art. We are in a very small town in rural North Carolina and the copper Lines are getting older and older and they are no longer servicing them. Caller: So the biggest issue here is that her home phone and her alarm system are through that copper and Brightspeed is offering the fiber. Caller: So the the reason that we are calling you is because if she has the fiber, she does not need 2 types of internet. Agent: And who was her cell phone provider? Caller: It is Verizon, but we we can not talk about the free mobile for a year right now. We got other bridges to Cross first. Agent: Right, so. Agent: What we just discussed, I do see a promotion if you want. Right now she is paying a total. Agent: Her reoccurring charges before taxes is 182. Agent: I do see a promotion we can offer her Internet of Spanish, Wi-fi and TV Select signature for 130 and it comes with a freelan of mobile service. Caller: Hold on a moment. Caller: Worthington Funeral Home, this is Hannah. Caller: No, no, son. Caller: Yeah, that is who, that is who we dealt with. Caller: Yeah, what was your name again? Caller: That is OK. And your phone number. Caller: OK, I will have. I will do my best to have him get in touch with you. Miss Sharon. Caller: You are Welcome. You are Welcome. Bye, bye. Caller: Sorry about that. OK, so I understand that the wonderful deal, the $130.00, my only concern is you are still trying to get her to have this. Caller: TV select and I just do not think that is necessary. Caller: , , OK. Agent: We know, madam, she picks her own package. So if she do not want to do the TV select signature, this is the package that she created. So if she do not want to do that, the next package down would be TV Choice, where you can pick out 15 channels of your choice and you can make changes to that channel line up at anytime for your spectrum. Agent: App after 30 Days. Caller: One. OK, wonderful. Caller: Ajá. Caller: Right. Agent: And then you get all your local separate. So she has the option to choose her own packages. Right now she currently has that TV select, but if she do go away from that she will lose all her free streaming outs. But it sounds like she is not using them anyway. So we do have choice 15 where she can pick out 15 channels of her choice. And if you want I can send you an e-mail of that choice 15 channel. Agent: Lawn up. Caller: That would be wonderful. Agent: Yes, madam. So yeah. And then also if you want, we have basic but choice 15, a workout for her because most of the channels that she liked watching, we can get those on the 15. Caller: OK. Is there by chance I could give you my e-mail address? Agent: I was just going to say she do not have One on file, so yes, hold on One Second. Caller: OK, we are going to use mine so I can help route in the future. Caller: So it is going to be Hannah H A N N A H , I am sorry. Agent: Hold on One Second. Let me. No, you are OK. Agent: OK, so you said Hannah H A N N A. Agent: H. Caller: H. Agent: -. Caller: H A Z E L Hannah E hazel. Agent: -. Caller: At gmail.com. Agent: OK so I have Hannah H H E hazel or is it just H hazel? Agent: Yes. Caller: So it is Hannah. It is like Hannah is H A N N A H and then the letter E and then Hazel. Agent: OK. Yes, madam, that is what I have. And let me go ahead and get this sent over to you. Caller: Yeah. Agent: And with this, it walks you through the steps too on how to change your channel lineup at the 30 Days. So if she wanted to do the TV Choice promotion, Bear with me. Caller: I bet you can pick all your channel. Caller: OK, I just do have One more question. Caller: I hate to sound like a broken record. Caller: But. Caller: If. Caller: What what is like the TV choice option look like with her 2 boxes? Because I do not think either of them are Smart TV. Caller: 2 boxes, TV Choice 15 and no internet. Agent: So if she wanted to do just TV Choice by itself, she is looking at roughly $90 for TV Choice. Bear with me. Agent: Let me see how much it is running in that area. Agent: So it would be $80 for ATV choice. Agent: And then the receiver is $15.00, so she has 2 of those. So it will be a total of 30. Agent: So she is looking at roughly 120. Caller: OK. Caller: Right. Agent: And that is before tax and it comes with a free line of mobile service if she want to take advantage of that. Caller: We will be in. Agent: And think you know what it has entered. She has that Entertainment view add fitting to that. So she is looking at roughly 125 for everything. Caller: But we can take that additional 15 off. Agent: Correct. It is up to her what changes she want to make to her account. We go, we apply things according to what she wants. Caller: So on July 3rd. Caller: Yeah. Caller: 107. Caller: Because you have a larger promotion there. Caller: All right, madam, I appreciate your time so much. Caller: Hold on One Second. Agent: You are Welcome. No. Caller: Worthington Funeral Home, this is Hannah. Agent: OK. Well, again, if you need, AI would not take the account that we are not making any changes today until you look over everything, OK? Caller: Can you hold on just a minute? Agent: Yes, madam. Agent: OK. Caller: Sorry to Bobby, but we need to, we need to just hold on. Bye bye. Caller: I just wanted to say thank you again for your help. I wish I could call back and speak to you directly because you were so hopeful. And, you know, like I said, we are going to, you know, get all our ducks in a Row and then we will figure out what is best for Miss Joan moving forward. But thank you so much for all this information. Agent: Your Welcome. And then also keep in mind with our promotions how it Works. It depends on how much service you bring over. You can get up to 3 years and we tell you guys like for example her promotion it. Agent: Date on our statement. Do you see that end date? Agent: So yes. Caller: Yeah, it looks like Last month when she called she renewed something and II do not know. Caller: Right. Caller: Right. Agent: So, so when you are in day ends, you are not paying standard rate for your service now, but when it ends, it could increase. So we tell you guys to call us back to let us know how your life change, if we need to lower your rate or keep you at the same rate. So anytime we offer promotions, we tell you guys to call us back so we can try to offer you a lower rate, OK, or keep you at the same rate. Caller: Yeah, and, and honestly, you know, I think it was just a misunderstanding. I am sure she did not realize that she had all this free stuff. It is just not something that she needs in her lifestyle. Agent: Yes, madam. Yes, madam. I understand. Trust me, I do, OK. Caller: , thank you so much and you have a great day. Agent: You too and again thank you for choosing Spectrum. Have a great rest of your day and it was nice talking to you and Miss Elliot. Caller: Thank you. Bye. Bye. Agent: You are Welcome. Bye.",4014541758046749,P3250057,28489CD47A746347ADDBD65AAA7CBEB4,AT&T,Verizon,Brightspeed,

I mean, it is still kind of early enough in the day, so they might be able to get somebody out, but that is that is going to be more or less something via tech.

Caller: Superior products, exceptional service and a commitment to always putting our customers first. That is Spectrum. Caller: Thank you for choosing Spectrum. We look forward to talking with you. Agent: Hello, Mister Rice. Caller: Hello. Agent: Hey, how are you doing today? Caller: I am pretty good. ¿How about you? Agent: I am doing pretty good. My name is Harold with Spectrum here in Charlotte, North Carolina. I was under the I was told that you were interested in lowering your Bill today. Caller: Yes, please. Caller: No. Agent: Alright so I was just reviewing your account and I see your paying roughly about 294 a month. Caller: Guía. Agent: Yeah, we can significantly lower that Bill down. Agent: So what is it that you would like to keep? Would you like to keep your services the same or? Caller: Other than. Caller: Roughly the same they are things are sort of extras thou we do not use, although it could. Caller: The benefits to not take them off just yet because we do like, for example, Disney Plus, Hulu and Max. We did not know that were included in our plan. Caller: And. Agent: In the select signature. Caller: I am sorry. Agent: In the select signature package. Caller: Yes, and we pay for them separately so like double dipping. Agent: . Caller: Yeah. So there is some things that we did not know, but definitely you would like to keep our Internet. Caller: Our landline. Caller: Mainly because it is tied into. Agent: The Security Systems and stuff. Caller: Yeah, and then our TV as well. Agent: OK. And how much you roughly looking to spend a month? Caller: , less than $294.00. Agent: I definitely understand that for sure. Caller: Am. Agent: , let us see what I can do for you. Agent: So what if I can get you down to 155? You will still be able to keep all of your services, including your landline. Now the 155 is for the Internet, gig, advanced Wi-fi and TV. Select signature, The Voice, which is your landline. That is a separate standalone charge of 25. Agent: So you will be roughly about 180. Agent: , let me see if I can find One lower. Agent: So I can get you down to 150. Agent: For that plan, for the Internet gig, the Wi Fi and the TV Select signature, it does come with a Unlimited line of mobile service free from One year. That is something that you could take advantage of. It is not required, but that is an option for you in case you want to take advantage of that feature. Agent: You can get that all in One bundle for 150 plus the 25 for the landline phone. So that brings you a 175. Agent: That significantly lower than the 294, it is almost $100 off. So it was more than $100 off so. Caller: Yeah. Question about that mobile line. Caller: , do we? I am assuming as part of the promotion, correct? Agent: Yes, it is part of the bundle deal. Caller: OK. And we do not use it. Caller: At the end of the year, Marc, how much is it that it is going to go up? Agent: It it will go up to 30, but we do have a promotion that we can add $10 to the account. Agent: A $10 promotion that would not make it $20 every month and you get Unlimited talk, text data, Access to 45000000 plus hotspots. You also get a a wonderful feature that I Love and utilize a lot called our Spectrum Speed Boost. What that enables your device to do, You get an extra gig of Speed every time you connect to our Spectrum Network, whether it be in home or out of the Network. Agent: Or out of the home. Agent: So you constantly be connecting wherever you go. Agent: Let is see, and if you have a device already, you could just bring on your Old device or if you like a new free phone, we could send One out. We have phones as little as $4 and 90. Was it 455 a month? So pretty much since you are getting the line for free, the only thing you will be paying for a device will be $4.55. Agent: And that is no contracts, no strings, nothing like that. So if you do want to cancel the line, you have the ability to do so. Agent: I mean, it is pretty much the balls in your court if when it comes to the mobile line, if you want that take advantage of it. You can, but you do not necessarily have to. And it does not necessarily have to be a phone. You could throw a tablet on there. Agent: In case you have like Children or a loved One that you know wants to utilize a tablet, we have tablets as low as I believe $7 a month. Caller: OK. And. Caller: Just to double check because we had a similar thing before. Caller: And. Caller: The. Caller: We never really used UMM. Caller: And we actually just turn that One off today. Agent: OK. Agent: No. Caller: Would would that be an issue? Because I think we did this. Caller: OK, so if we get The New line and it goes down to. Caller: The 180 and some changes that you mentioned, after a year it will go up to xxx. Agent: And at that point in time, if you do not want it, just give us a call and we can take that off your account also. Agent: What I was going to say, after the year, you could just give us a call back and we can actually throw another promo onto the account and that will offset any additional standard rates or that you would be having to pay. So instead of paying the standard rate after that year Mark, you can just give us a call and set a reminder on your phone for September the 16th, 2026 to give us a call and say hey, you know, my promo is about to roll off. Agent: What promos can you offer me? And we can actually do the same process that we are doing now. I could do well, the next representative can go through and just add on a new promotion for you with better pricing or One that can match. But I am pretty sure at that point in time we will have One that that will be beat this promo. Caller: OK. Caller: OK. And. Caller: As far as services changes, , are there any Like TV are always still getting the same channels Same. Agent: yeah, yeah, you get everything the same. II did not touch any other package. I left everything'cause with the select signature pretty much. I found the package that you already had, I just had One at a discounted rate. Caller: Ok. Caller: And. Caller: He said that. Caller: None of the. Caller: Stuff changed, so we still have those streaming apps correct that we could use. Agent: yes, most definitely. Caller: Ok, okay, am. Caller: As far as equipment? Caller: Are we still we are still keeing our receivers correct? Agent: Let is see, Yes, you still going to get your receivers? Agent: They actually still on here? Agent: Let is see. Agent: Let me see exactly what it is going to charge'cause I know he, the representative had did mention something about you being charged for the receivers and that would help lower that Bill significantly down. Caller: Yes. Agent: And we want it select signature. Agent: Boom 150. Agent: Boom, boom, let us see what it would charge you with the receivers'cause I know, he said. I think that is like an additional $45.00. Yes, it is. Agent: And you said keep the landline, correct? Caller: IES. Agent: OK. Agent: Let is see here promo. Agent: Got all those services. Agent: So, , what about the Latino view for 15? Because I see that is on here as well. Did you want that selected? Caller: Yes, my mother-in-law, she mainly speaks Spanish, so. Agent: I got you OK. Caller: , yeah. As, , One other thing that i was going to ask , since we use the DVR mainly for her. Caller: To record her shows whenever were not at home for her to watch. Caller: Is there like an equivalent with the digital or like the Wi-fi boxes that they have like a recording option or anything like that? Agent: , let me see. I know we have a cloud DVR, but let me see if it is compatible with the TV select. Agent: The. Agent: So we could I could give you the cloud DVR Unlimited with the gig. Agent: That way, let me see, where is the other DVR? So that way you could actually remove the DVR receiver. Agent: And let me see if it will take like that. Agent: Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you. Agent: It is dusty in here. Caller: I am sorry, you said Gigg. Caller: ¿What is what is that mean? Agent: The storage for the DVR. So you have a gigabyte of storage. Agent: It is 1000 megabytes. Caller: Ok. Agent: So that is how much memory you will have in the cloud for saving movies and shows. Agent: OK, so it did allow me to do that. Agent: So did you want to keep? Agent: So you have how many receivers do you have in the home, One or 2? I see we have 2:00 in the home. Caller: We have 31 DVR. Caller: And then 2. digital recibirs. Agent: OK, so with the. Agent: With One with the DVR receiver, we could eliminate that receiver and actually just have her use the cloud DVR service. Agent: And it is pretty much it Works the same exact way you use this, the remote the same way you would and when you are recording with the receiver. Agent: And you will just be recording through the cloud, so whenever you want to retrieve videos it is the same exact. Agent: The same steps to do so. Caller: OK, , he said. It was on the . Tusson megabyte. Caller: Is that is that upgradable? Because she records a few shows and I feel like that is going to not going to be enough work. Agent: I mean, it is it is totally up to you. The gig should be enough. Agent: How big are the? So when you do record things, how big are the files when you record them? Caller: ¿Am i there? Like an hour Long each like episode or like sho. Caller: I would have to go downstairs and double check. Caller: The sizes let me, let me. Agent: OK, no Rush. Caller: I am not able to actually find the the sizes of the files. There way to actually do that? Agent: Let me go in and check. Caller: , sí. But it says it is 71% full. Agent: So how many movies and how many total? Agent: How much total content do you have on there? Caller: One series, there is 175 recordings. Caller: There is One that has 14, another has 3. Caller: 200 recordings. Agent: OK. Agent: Alright, I am actually looking that up for you right now. Agent: OK. So traditional DVR storage space is determined by the capacity of the receiver. So if you have the enhanced DVR, it can record up to 150 hours of HD programming, which would be equivalent to One terabyte of storage. If you have the cloud DVR, which is the grandfathered version, and I do not believe you have that One, it stores up to 50 recordings for a maximum of 90 Days. Agent: If you have the cloud DVR Unlimited, you get Unlimited recording, each saved for up to 270 Days. Agent: , let me see what type of D V T V D V R S you have though. Just a Second. Agent: So you have. Agent: Yep. So you got the 210 DVR so you can record up to 185 hours of HD content, which is the equivalent to One terabyte or 1000 gigabytes. Agent: The storage can be expanded with external hard drives for some models. So yeah. So with the particular device that you have in the home right now, you can record up to 185 hours of HD movies and shows, which is One One terabyte of storage. Caller: Ok. Caller: And you said the cloud One is 1000. Megabytes. ¿Right? Agent: Gigabytes. Caller: , so it is. Caller: One terabyte of cloud storage. Agent: , you, you know what I am, I am sorry, II just misunderstood what you were saying. Yeah. So the cloud. So yeah, I could give you the cloud DVR Unlimited. So that will give you the Unlimited storage if you decide to go to the cloud route, but your receiver has. Agent: One terabyte of storage so it is 1000 gigs so I could give you. Agent: Yeah. So you get the Unlimited with the gig, so. Agent: You could use the services as much as you want. Agent: If you have your own routers across the screen. Caller: OK. And. Caller: If I were to go to that One, , what would be the cost? Agent: That is actually included, that is free. So if you wanted to go to cloud route, that is actually no charge for that. Caller: OK, so it will be. Also, he said. It was Unlimited. Agent: Yes, sir. Agent: Because you already have 2 HD receivers. Agent: Which qualifies you to get the cloud DVR Unlimited for free so. Caller: , OK. And if we were to. Caller: Turn those 2 AC receivers also to Xumo boxes. Would I still qualify or no? Agent: Let me see if it will allow that. Agent: Yeah, it looks like it. It did accept it. So yeah, you could actually remove those 2 because that was, that is an additional $30 that you are being charged for because it is $15 per receiver. Agent: So he is actually 45 because you had 3 receivers, so if how many were you wanting to take off? Caller: At this 0.3 or 3. The DVR. Caller: And the other thing. Agent: And the 2 HD receivers OK. Caller: Yes. And then just if we could use the Xumo boxes for those. Agent: OK, that is a Smart Move. Caller: No, we also get rid of all the extra cables around our homes. Agent: Ah, so yeah, it does require at least One receiver. That is what I was afraid of. Caller: , OK. Agent: you know what, let me see if I can add the zoom on to offset. Agent: To offset that. Agent: To Spectrum Cloud DVR requires at least One of the following. Agent: D V R H E. Agent: Xumo box. So let me see if I can go add the Xumo on. Agent: Where is the Xumo? Where is the Xumo? Agent: And how many Xumo boxes did you were looking to add? Caller: , just the same number of, , receivers that we have. So 3. Agent: I want 3 of them OK. Agent: Gonna go zoomo. Agent: my goodness. Agent: So just Bear with me. One to 2 moments. Looks like my system froze for some reason. I am going to have to go back out and go back in. Caller: No, it is. Thank you so much for helping. Agent: no, it is no problem at all. That is that is why I am here. Agent: So I am a place on a brief 32nd hold. I will be able to hear you, you just will not be able to hear me. So if you do need me, just give me a shout and I will be right back on the line for you. Caller: Hi, thank you. Agent: Alright, thank you. Welcome. Agent: . Agent: Nay, nay, come here, come here. Agent: So what if I want to add 3 zumos for this person, right? What? What which code? I know it is a silly question, I have done it so many Times I just can not remember. So I put $35 on here. Why? Is it a way I can make it? Agent: . Agent: What you all do for break? Agent: At the top. Agent: Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Agent: I had a slow moment. Agent: Thank you so much for holding. I am definitely back and I got you all straightened out here. Caller: Sí. Agent: OK, so now I am at the point where I go back. Agent: And so we got your Xumo boxes. Agent: Wanna take this receiver off? Give you the cloud DVR? Agent: Take the other 2 receivers off. Agent: Now we are going to send out a new modem. Agent: Which is updated modem is just going to handle the internet gig and the advanced Wi-fi. It will handle those capabilities. Agent: We got your zoomo box. Caller: Is the it is just out of Curiosity because we have a mesh? Caller: Wi-fi system install in our home is The New modem. Also a router is just a modem. Agent: It is you will get the Moto Man router. Caller: OK. Agent: They are going to, yeah, they are going to send out both to you. Caller: And I am assuming there is also like a service charge for this? Agent: For what? The Motorman router? Caller: Yes. Agent: No, that is only if you like, let us say, cancel the service and decide to keep the equipment. That is when it will be a charge. Caller: OK. So it is not like the DVRS where they have like a? Caller: Like a charge just for having them. Agent: Each month? No. No. Agent: Yeah, there. There is no fee for that. Caller: OK, so 11 The New modem gets here, we just have to return the Old One, right? Agent: Yes. Caller: Es. Caller: And just out of Curiosity, . Caller: Is there any cable installations that needs to come along with The New modem? Agent: No, you just Hook it up in the same way that your existing modem and router are setup. So pretty much 11 you receive the equipment in 2 Days. Just just get like a visual picture of how the you know the yellow Ethernet core goes into the yellow port and your coax OK will go into the modem and from there it is pretty much just plug and play. Caller: OK. Agent: So we got the Latino view still on here. Agent: , I just want to make sure you have got all of your services you currently had. Agent: Got the swap modem. Agent: So you will be paying 5625 for your internet because you get the gig for $55.00. Agent: , let us see, we got your cloud DVR with the game. We got 3 Zumos. Agent: Alright, so you will be looking at 2:01 25. Agent: Let me see something here. Agent: So it is requiring for at least One . Agent: So yeah, I have got the Xumo box on here. Why is it? Alright, so let me place you on another brief. Agent: Brief holders, I am trying to pretty much add the DVR Unlimited, the cloud DVR, but it is tell I am coming to a roadblock. It is basically saying that it requires One of the following and I have got the Xumo box on here as One of the requirements. Agent: . Agent: But so just Bear with me One Second. I am going to have to, , bypass this. Agent: Thank you so much. Caller: OK. Agent: Sorry for the wait. Yeah, so it is requiring at least One, , DVR on the account in order for me to add the cloud DVR on with the Unlimited. Agent: . So they. Caller: Am muy bien. One DVR. Agent: Yeah, it is just saying that it it needs to have One on the account. Caller: I think if that is the case and we will just keep the DVR that we have. Agent: OK. Agent: And I will just. Caller: There is no, There is no. Caller: There is no other DVR, is there? Like that is? Agent: No, I just put that One on there and then I get it allowed me to add the cloud DVR Unlimited. Caller: Out. Agent: And that way I can proceed. It is just that was the roadblock. Caller: OK. Agent: It just required at least One DVR to be on this on my account. Caller: I mean, if if we have the physical DVR, i do not think we would need the actual cloud One. Agent: OK. Agent: Yeah, that makes sense it. Agent: The DVR. Caller: If that makes sense, because she is she is literally the only One that uses the cloud. The Santa Claus, the the DVR. To record us or to record our shows. Caller: ¿Sólo es novela es? Agent: OK. So I mean it is it is it is no charge for it. So I could just add the receiver back and then give you the the cloud Unlimited as well. So you could. Agent: Pretty much have more storage space. Caller: Ok. Agent: And so I am coming up to The Last final steps here. Agent: Too many DVR components are selected. Let me see alright back. Agent: SÍ. Agent: Alright, just One Second. Agent: Yeah, II might have One on this call, but. Agent: I got I know man. I am running into an issue with these DVRS so I was trying to talk them into getting the cloud DVR but Long story short they said they just want to keep it as it is. They had 3, I took off 2 and left One. But do I select? Is it making me select any of these? Is that why I am getting these errors? Agent: You got the box so you need DVR service. So I just click this One for fire. Agent: OK, OK. That is I just wanted to make sure'cause I seen the Price Jump and I did not know if it was charging at 15:00 plus the 5. Agent: It is. So it is like $20.00. Agent: So they why, why would it, why would it do that? Because you got the box in the DVR service. Agent: So the box is the equipment, the service is what make sure equipment capable to record. Agent: . Agent: So what if I so if I wanted to give him the cloud? Agent: Would it take that I still have to have this on? Agent: OK, OK. That is my issue was I got you. Agent: Alright so I am about to try to lock in on his mobile'cause he sound like he was interested. Alright, thanks. Agent: Alright, thank you so much. I got it to finally take. Caller: Sí. Agent: So did you want a technician to come or, or was it something that you feel like you could pretty much set it up yourself? Caller: For the Xumo boxes. Agent: Yeah the Xumo boxes are just plug and play. I was referring to the the modem and the router. You want to self install those as well? Agent: OK. Caller: , no. And if I do not have to, if there, if there is no like Need for new cables, then no, we could just I could do that, yeah. Agent: OK. Caller: He said there is going to be a modem and a router, correct? Agent: Yes. Caller: And it is not like a built in One. Like a 211. ¿Or is it? 2 separate things. Agent: It is 2 separate ones, yeah. Caller: OK. Agent: So did you want to take advantage of the mobile the mobile line today? Caller: I thought i was. I thought that was tied in with the promotion. Agent: Yes it is. I was just saying did you want the free phone that comes with it? Caller: No. We have a device that we could use if we were to use the. Agent: OK, so. Caller: I guess we would just need a SIM card, is that if those things are still around. Agent: Yeah, yeah, we provide Sims. Agent: So. Agent: What I have to do'cause do you have the device with you right now? Caller: Yes. Agent: OK, alright, nice. So just Bear with me One moment. I am going to get that setup. Caller: It was honestly the same device I was tied in with the previous line. Agent: OK, let me see if that will work it it should work but let me see. Agent: So you are going to be at 2:20 125, so that saves you $73 by revamping this whole plan for you. Caller: OK. Caller: And that is because we are keeping that DVR, right? Agent: Yeah, if, if'cause I tried to take it off. I tried. I swear I tried, man. The system just would not allow me to do it. So you are paying 5625 for the internet and one:40 in the TV services? Agent: Charging you 15 for the Latino view, 15 for the receiver. Agent: The actual TV service itself is 95. Agent: And let me go back One Second,'cause this, the TV Select Plus is an additional 10, but that is where you get all of those bundled streaming services at no cost. Agent: And then The Voice for 25 and then that DVR service for 5. Agent: So that is where pretty much all that comes in. Agent: And then you got the. Caller: ¿I am sorry, which? DVR service. Caller: okay. Agent: Just the regular, the DVR box, the One that you currently have, yeah, it is, it is they charge you $5 to enable the device to record. Agent: So yeah, that is a $5 separate charge. Agent: So yeah, you are looking at 2:20, 125. Agent: And your new equipment will be here 3rd or be there Thursday September the 18th. So it is 2 Days from now. Agent: And. Agent: Does everything sound pretty pretty good and straightforward for you? Caller: So far, yeah. I was just wondering, . Caller: He said that there is no charges for the router, right? Agent: Yes, there is no charge unless let us say you would cancel your services and decide to keep the equipment. That is when they will charge it for it. Caller: OK, . Caller: Alright then. , give me One Second. Please. Agent: You for real? Agent: I am I am sorry, what was that? Caller: Give me One quick Second, sorry. Agent: OK, no problem. Caller: Ok ya. Everything. Everything is seems pretty good. Agent: OK. Agent: Alright, so I am going to go ahead and submit this order for you. Agent: Let me see. Agent: Customer is Credit card. Agent: Alright, so let me see about adding that other line for you. Agent: So you said you just deactivated that line today, right? Caller: I restarted it, yes. , I believe they said that it was going to turn off at the end of the billing cycle. Agent: That could be the issue I am running into and it is saying that I believe it is because. Agent: Line will remain active until the next billing cycle. Yep, that is exactly what it is. So your next billing cycle is. Agent: The 29th. Caller: Luis, OK. Agent: So you can actually take you can take advantage of the line is just unfortunately has to be after the 20 28th, I am sorry on the 29th. Agent: So just a few more Days, about 10, 11:50 Days and you will be able to get that line active activated. Caller: But everything else is still active, right? Agent: , yeah, yeah, your your plans already been updated to the latest pricing and that I said it to take Effect today is just the mobile side that is. Agent: But you can always. I mean, that free line is always entitled to you on this account, so no matter. Agent: You know, even though it is saying that it has to wait, that all you have to do if you do not want to take advantage of it that day, you can take advantage after. But yeah, it will be available to use on the 29th. Agent: Well, after the day after the 29th, which is the 30th, so. Caller: OK, sounds good. Caller: And then. Since the phone is going to need a SIM card, I am assuming the SIM card is going to get sent. Caller: After that line is turned off. Agent: Yeah, after you call and the line is deactivated, just give us a call back, have a new mobile account setup. Agent: New mobile line setup, and then we will send out the SIM card for you. We will set that up. Caller: OK, sounds good. Agent: Alright, so it looks like I got you all set mr areas. Was there anything else I could Assist you with today? Caller: No. I think that is pretty much it. Agent: All right. Caller: You are amazing, Thank you very much. Agent: No, thank you.

And so the tech basically just said, OK, just call, , this number and we will reach out to you. They, he missed a call from them, I guess. So he is calling to cancel'cause he does not know what to do with the boxes and like he does not like that. Agent: They basically left him without anything so.

Agent: I know you said the tech can not do that. I know that if you get the permission from the landlords and the top one, just something like, hey, I do know you are getting like a really good promotion as well too, like $30 for your Internet, which is really good Sir. I would hate for that one to go it away. I actually might be lower than that. Agent: 'Cause he speaks mostly Spanish, so I can not really. Agent: Too much. Agent: If you. Agent: Sound like, hey, do you like maybe a Spanish interpreter or like even like the Spanish department? I get you over to them so you help you out. If not, if you understand me, that is totally fine. I just got to go through this process and everything too, Sir. And then just kind of get them as options, right? OK, Like I was saying. And if not, if he does not go for any of them, maybe I can not take over. Just kind of still follow. Just try to do like one offer. He is really good. He is just going to see you on value because he is on a rest ready. Agent: This promotion, so just kind of see what he has on there and if he does not want to take it. I know that the the landlords, they can also, if you get permission from them, the management office, they can also like draw the holes and stuff. Usually that happens with apartments and stuff. So we can just help them out like that. If you did not say no to that, okay. Agent: From like a transfer. You want to learn how to do that? I can show you, OK Keep us updated, OK? Agent: If he does disconnect, I can put your approval or not yet. Agent: Yeah, OK. Agent: It is going to be a Nino, okay? Agent: Okay, but I will still use this template, right? The disco approval.

Agent: To the next place if they do allow you to drill holes. OK, but I can also. Caller: I guess yours number so I will I will let let her know about that. Agent: OK, Sir. Yeah, of course. And you know, like even if you do like get permission, I can also, you know, put in another work order just so they can, you know, like or even tell them if they could not even call you just to like let you know, like your options on how they can possibly install that without even having to drill any holes in as well. Caller: They they want, they want. Agent: OK, alright, Sir. Caller: Yes, I asked. I asked for the permission last time and no, they did not. Caller: So. Agent: OK.

I am now going to try to see how to rectify that on there, which is that is probably why it is showing that it was still on there in one second. But I think I found the issue.

Agent: So with the internet going back to being by itself right now it will be at $30.15. It looks like you had a Credit on your account, or excuse me, it is like a promotion. It is the ACP affordable connectivity Program. Agent: So it looks like those promotions, they are going to start to fall off in November. So if you call us back around that time, we can see if there is anything new available to replace that with. Caller: Ok sí. Agent: Alright, so getting that submitted now, do you have any questions at all? Caller: No, madam. Thank you. Thank you so much. Agent: Alright, so let me just finish this. Agent: OK. Agent: Perfect. Agent: All right, Oscar, that is all set here. You should get an e-mail within the next 24 hours telling you what changes we made removing the TV and leaving just the internet by itself. Agent: Is there anything else that I can do for you today? Caller: So the the Bill is going to be only the $68.00. Caller: The mobile and the internet is that it is going to end up with. Agent: So the mobile One that will not change, that will still be the 68. And then I did do the 30 day money back guarantee for the TV. It has been a little bit more than 30 Days, but it should still work. So I would give it 48 hours for that to reflect. Agent: On your Bill and then check back it should say the $30.15. Caller: Yeah. And you said that the mobile line is $68 just for the mobile Lines itself? Agent: Yes, it is $30 per line and you are financing the devices. So that is where the $8 comes from. Caller: But I only have One mobile line. Is that something that you? Because I am not using the other One. The other One has been canceled a Long time. Agent: No, but has not been cancelled. When had you requested for that to be done? Caller: About a year ago. Caller: Yeah. Agent: A year ago. Caller: Mjm. Agent: , it must have been that you were getting One of those Lines for free in that first year. So let me go back in time. Caller: Yeah, the only One that I am using is. Caller: The only One that I am using is, , the 6477. Agent: Let me see. Agent: OK. Well, yeah, it does look like that is what happened. The One line, it was free for that year and then it looks like, I believe it was January that had fallen off. So the other phone that is not that Motorola, it is a orbit. It is One of the flip phones. Do you know where it is at? Caller: No, no, no. I am not using it so. Agent: OK. So that line, it is still being financed. It looks like it has a $42 balance on it. So if we were to cancel that wine, it would end up being due immediately on the next cycle? Agent: So what I can do, Oscar, I can actually suspend that line that you guys are not using. I can do a suspension on it for up to 90 Days at a time. And what that would do, it would take away the $30 that you pay for the service and you would just pay the monthly financing installment and and we would be able to do that. Agent: For 90 Days at a time. Caller: OK. Agent: So do that. Agent: OK. Yeah. That way you do not have to worry about the full balance on that next cycle. Agent: , but yes, I am generating that now. Agent: And then just. Agent: Well, it kind of Works out timewise when you are getting ready to call in November. Agent: To talk about the internet, since your promotion is going to be falling off, you can ask about your that mobile line as well seeing about extending the suspension. Caller: , OK. Agent: All right. Agent: Right, Oscar, is there anything else I can do? Caller: No, no. Thank you so much. That is all. Agent: Absolutely. Well, I thank you so much for your time today, Oscar, and for being the best part of Spectrum. I Hope you have a blessed rest of your week. Agent: Thank you. Bye. Bye. Caller: You too. Thank you, madam. Bye. Bye.",7100301758047164,P3283476,F72AF19F95108C4CA296064DDF3B45E8,T-Mobile,Verizon,,

2025-09-16,"Agent: Hi, this is Sophie with Spectrum in Austin, Texas. How May I Assist you today? Caller: I just was speaking with a Lady, she transferred me over because I literally just checked my e-mail and there is like a a whole big upgrade order that needs to be canceled because I did not do it. Agent: OK. , just looking at looking to a Bill that you got on the account, I can definitely help you out with that. Caller: No, I just I just got emails an hour ago. Caller: Of a order that was placed and it looks like it added everything and I am like no man, Press him. No turkey. I did not order none of this stuff and II do not know if you can see it. Agent: So you are looking at, OK, so like a e-mail that was sent like that said that some changes were just made to the account? Agent: OK. Caller: Yes, it is like we received your order. Hi Pamela, thank you for your order placed on September 15, 2025. Year Services has been updated as requested. Well, I order no service. They gave me Spectrum plus, select TV select plus. Caller: And then it says upgrade. Caller: And I only have internet and it says internet and then it is giving me all these streaming service. Disney basic, HBO Max would have Paramount, Peacock, ESPN, AMC. I did not add none of this stuff. I do not even watch TV. Agent: OK. I could definitely look into that for you. That does sound a bit odd, especially if it just happened and you, I am assuming you did not make any phone calls to Spectrum, correct? Caller: Just this phone call I am on right now. I checked my e-mail, checking my e-mail and when I seen that I am like I did not place an order. Agent: OK, I can definitely look into that for you to go ahead and verify the account. Could I have your first and Last name? Caller: Pamela Jones. Agent: All right, and your service address? Caller: 801 Highbrook Drive, Arlington, Texas 76001. Agent: Alright. Agent: OK, so I am getting into the account now. Agent: Get a look at what I am seeing here. Agent: Alright so I am seeing your internet is set for a gig plan. It is that looking right? Is that the what you had originally was the gig for the internet? Caller: I do believe so. Yes. Agent: OK, OK, so the internet seems to be the same. I am seeing that TV that was. Agent: Let me see here. Caller: I only have internet and I have my mobile is through you all too. That is it. Agent: Yeah, I am seeing that mobile on here. Let me see. Agent: OK. I am seeing I think where it came from. So do you have? Agent: A Roku TV in the home that maybe somebody else that is not you has Access to. Caller: There is a Roku TV. Agent: OK, because it is looking like that is how it was added. So on the Roku TV is there is an option to upgrade your TV package. It looks like it is showing me that the because I can see certain changes that were made to the account I am seeing creation date of. Agent: 916 for that TV, select generic TWC Roku stream online. So it is looking like it was most likely added by someone by the TV. Agent: If I had to guess, because if it was not you and you did not call in to do that, let me look at the notes on the account as well. Agent: Yeah, the earliest I am seeing is notes from. Caller: no. Agent: Earlier in the summer from The Last time you called. So it does not look like there is any notes about someone calling in pretending to be you to get those services added. So it is looking like either by error or maybe someone added it, maybe a kid or something. It is actually Crazy. The call that I had before you was actually the same exact scenario. She was calling in to get TV removed because One of her younger One of the kids in the Family was messing around on the CV. Caller: Mmm. Agent: And managed to to order TV services and did not tell anybody until she saw it on her Bill. So yeah, it is looking like it was added via the TV. Do you know if is there anyone in the House who could have done that or possibly maybe even you by accident? Caller: No. It was not me. Now somebody i do. I do have some visitors, but it was not me. Agent: OK, OK, I see. Yeah, I mean, I totally understand. This is definitely not the first time I have seen it. So rest assured you are not going Crazy or anything. And it does not look like anybody. It does not look like an identity theft situation either, so. Agent: Yeah, I know that feeling. Caller: , I am grateful for that because, , with this e-mail just looked too real. I was like, OK, II did not know that people could do that through through the TV without me calling in. Agent: Yeah, some of some of the TV is do have that option. I am not even sure exactly how people do that. I do not have a Smart TV where because I do not have a way to do that online because I do not have a Roku. So I am honestly not sure how to do it either. I do know a way to prevent it in the future though. There should be in your settings. Caller: Mjm. Agent: I am not sure if it is the regular device settings or account settings or something like that, but you should be able to add a purchase pin that way. Whoever wants to try to make purchases on that Roku would need to know that code in order to get that to go through. At least a way to get that to prevent that from happening in the future, since it does seem like it is pretty easy. Agent: Sounding like it is just a few clicks of a Button. Caller: It sounds like it, yeah. They just push a Button and add at them. No, no, we will do this. Agent: Yeah, but what I can do is I can definitely see about getting that removed for you, especially since it was just added today. I should not see an issue. Caller: Yeah, it looks like an hour. Well, I got the e-mail, it says an hour ago. Agent: Yeah. So it should not be a problem as far as making sure you do not get charged for that, especially since it, you know, seems to be added in some type of error or, you know, without permission. The only thing that matters is that you did not authorize it and you did not add it. So I can definitely get that fixed for you. I am just going to go ahead and. Agent: Start working on that and try to get that taken off for you. I am just going to go ahead and place you on a brief hold while I work on that and I will be back in a couple of minutes, OK? Caller: OK thanks. Agent: All right. Thank you. Agent: As up at these Roku is man. Agent: Describe you The Wi-fi itself is $10.00, so that was actually. Agent: Paying. Agent: Taxes. Agent: So yeah, there you are. So yeah, you are saving like 90 Bucks. So do I have your permission to go ahead and submit this fantastic order? Agent: Alright. Caller: Hojas. Caller: Roxy. Caller: I mean, Shelby, shut up. Caller: Come here. Agent: All right, madam, I have got this all setup and ready to get that TV removed for you. Before we went ahead and went ahead with that, I just wanted to double check and make sure that you did not want to go ahead since it is already on the account. Just try it for the month and see how you like it. There would be a 30 day money back guarantee if you ended up not liking it, but we could definitely still get that removed for you. I just wanted to double check and just make sure there was not a chance you wanted to see how you did like that Spectrum cable. Caller: You know, first of all, I work 2 Jobs, I do not even have time to watch TV, that is why I only have internet. Agent: yeah I totally understand that. II actually have 2 zumos at my House and I try to watch live TV and somehow I always end up choosing sleep over that, so I totally understand. Caller: Yeah, I clearly have not turned my TV on today. Agent: All right. It is going to go ahead and get that removed for you. I just wanted to make sure I do have everybody acceptance to go ahead and process this order. It is just going to be your Internet and it is just going to get you back down to that original $100.00. Caller: Yes. Agent: Alright, just go ahead and do that. Now give me One moment. Caller: Thank you. Agent: All right, went ahead and got that removed for you and you know since it was within the same billing cycle, obviously within the same day, you will not see anything on that next Bill as far as that TV. Caller: OK. Sounds good. Thank you so much. Agent: Alright, you are very Welcome. The only thing I would just advise, you know, make a Note of it if you do not feel like it right now, but go and check that Roku TV, definitely make a pin and do not share it with anybody in the House and make sure nobody can add TV again. Agent: Yeah. Caller: You are absolutely right,'cause that aint going to happen. You are right. No, I feel you. , definitely. So in the Roku you. I mean, I know. Caller: I know there is a way, I guess it is in settings, right? Is it in settings? Caller: OK. Agent: , yeah, it should be in the settings on the actual device itself. , I am not too familiar with the Roku. I do not personally have One, so I am not totally sure on the details of it, but I do know for sure it is in your settings. And I do know for a fact that they do have a way to put a purchase pin specifically for situations like this to make sure, you know, kids who get a hold of the remote or, you know, somebody who just feels like doing whatever they want to do. Ca not, you know, add, add something on somebody else is card. They do not got their name on it. So, you know, be able to prevent that at least. Caller: III just I mean, I know the Roku is on the same internet, but I get that is Crazy. I mean,'cause I am sure to add it had to ask them something. Caller: Fue de. Caller: And I am the Second One. Agent: Alright, so just a recap. Yeah. And I am not even sure what that process is'cause I, again, I have never seen it with my own eyes. I have strictly heard it through customers calling in with this exact scenario, which is, you know, kind of funny that Roku has not figured that out yet. Yeah, just Tonight and in a Row. That is, that is a, that is a new thing. I guess something is in the water. People want to watch TV. Caller: Alright, well, I would definitely do that. I am going to definitely I am going upstairs soon as I got phone and go and put that pin on and be like madam, madam, I know you want to watch TV. Caller: We do not do that here. Agent: Look, sometimes people got to know, you know, benefit of the doubt is a nice thing, but you know, you only get it 11. Caller: You are right. Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate you. Agent: You are very Welcome. Thanks so much for Conspect. I Hope you have a good rest of your night. Caller: Thanks. Bye, bye. Agent: Bye bye.

2025-09-16,"Caller: Hello. Agent: Hello, this is Dwayne Charlotte, North Carolina Spectrum Customer Solutions. Who do I have the pleasure to speak to? Caller: This ridge. What is going on, Dwayne? I am in Dallas here. , quick question for you. I have a account here. Caller: It is supposedly still act different when I am seeing it will not allow me to do a UCM ticket for an OTL. The gentleman here, Mister Garcia, turned in his equipment and called us on the 7th of August to let us know that he was moving out of the state and was not taking the services the agent with him. Caller: Advised him of the options that he have, but they did not do anything. So he was telling him how to return the equipment. So the man turned returned the equipment and he thought that minute turned his services off. I was going to try to put in an OTL for him to see if we can get that addressed, but it is not even giving me the link. It is it is blank. Agent: OK. And it is in the Note that he previously requested this in the past in the notes? Caller: Yes, sir, August the 7th, it just shows a phone call where he called and let us know that he was moving out of the state. He no longer wanted the services. How do he return? Agent: OK. Caller: And it is like it, I do not know, it did not go anywhere. He just told him how to return it. Caller: And told him that he needed to disconnect the services. But it did not go nowhere from there. Agent: OK. I mean, in the notes on the 7th in August, it says that the representative that they spoke to in this department, they made no changes because it looks like he did not know what he wanted to do at that time. Agent: That is why it is still active. Agent: Returning equipment, though it would not close the account, he asked it. Caller: Staying at and I definitely let him know that it, but if he did not know what he wanted to do, why did he return the equipment? Caller: He said exactly what he wanted to do in the. Caller: I am not, I am not. And, and and you know, again, this is not to argue with him for nothing. It is just how can I help him? I can not write A U C A U C M to help him. So I do not know if it is something you guys can do with a disconnect or something. I do not. I am kind of at a loss for words without being able to write up at UCM. Agent: yeah, yeah. So I can close the account. It is just, , the whole thing about the UCM, there has to be like a basis for it. And that is the part I was trying to clarify. Caller: So are you. I got you like I do not know. Caller: , so you are not seeing anything that would be valid in your opinion? Agent: Yes, from this department, in the notes on August 7th, it just says hold on. Caller: Well, all we could do is advise him now to disconnect the services at this point. Agent: Yeah, it says he called in, he had questions about steps to take the transfer or disco services, did not know new address nor date of moving in form of steps to take when transferring or disco, no changes made to account. So. Agent: It. Caller: He did not ask for that. The notes is clearly saying how do I return the equipment? Caller: That is not a person that sounds like they want to do a transfer. Caller: The phone call on the 7th is clearly saying that man came in asking how to return this equipment. He is moving out of state. Agent: Hold on, let me see here. Caller: I was looking at the summary. Caller: Moving to Arizona wants to know the procedure for returning in their equipment. Agent: This is August 7th of this year. Agent: I do not see that on here unless. Caller: Yes sir, it is what I am looking at right here. Bear with me One Second, I can screenshot it to you. Agent: No, it is Fine. Let me see here. Agent: Maybe I have the wrong account? Is this just that 2744 East? Caller: Yep, and you do not see the the the interaction. Agent: No, there is all mine. Caller: On August the 7th at one:37 PM. Caller: Alright. Agent: No, I do not see that. It just says August 7. It says has questions and then it just goes to August 14th. Caller: And you are in historic notes. Agent: Yes. Agent: Core. Agent: , OK. Caller: No sir, interactions right next to it. Agent: OK. Thank you. Caller: Mjm. Agent: Let me see. Agent: yeah, I do say that. Caller: And , like I said, my Hand is tight. I can not even write up at UCM. Caller: You see the well, I am not sure what what what you can see here, but yeah, it is not even giving me the option. The link is not. Agent: OK, let me just read this really quick. Let me see here. Caller: OK, OK. Caller: I aint asking you to work a miracle, man. I just some kind of you know which way to go from here'cause I am kind of my hands tired a little bit. Agent: No, you are Fine. , I mean, if you want you could just transfer them here. I can handle them from here. Caller: , I got you. I am going to get him right to you. Thank you, sir. Agent: Mm-. Alright, no problem. Caller: Mjm. Agent: Hello, this is Duane Charlotte, North Carolina Spectrum Customer Solutions. Is this Mister Garcia? Caller: Yes, it is. Agent: Perfect. Now they are saying you have let me see. You returned your equipment already, Mrs Garcia. Caller: Yes. Agent: OK, let me see here. Agent: I am just reading the notes on this account. Caller: Ajá. Agent: All right, Mister Garcia. Now before I explain anything, I just need to clarify a few things. So you have no reason to call back now in the notes they were saying. Agent: You in the past, it looks like it happened in August, you were planning on moving to Arizona, is that right? Agent: OK. Do you ever Move there? Caller: Yes. Caller: You see how that is where I met? Agent: OK. Do you have spectrum there now? Caller: There is no spectrum here. Agent: OK, . Agent: Because I am trying to find a way to apply a Credit adjustment before I close this, , just to reconfirm what is that new address to reconfirm we are not in that area? Caller: I do not even know it yet. Agent: OK. Caller: No exacto. Caller: Put the change of address. Caller: xxxx. Caller: Mcculloch Boulevard. Agent: Mm-. Caller: North Unit 102. Caller: Lake Havasu City. Caller: Arizona. Caller: And it is 86403. Agent: OK. Thank you. Agent: , yeah, no, we are not in that area. All right, No problem. And no Family or Friends were staying at your Old address, right, Mister Garcia, who want your account? Caller: No, no, no they could not. Caller: You know, rather than an apartment Building and I had to get the key back. Caller: You know, when I had, when I had called, you know I had and they told me about that too. You know, that they did not have no spectrum out this way because II would have shifted it over here. But you know, they do not even have here. Caller: So you know, when I told him that I would be leaving on the 15th and I had already turned in my equipment? Agent: Mm-. Caller: You know, and just waiting here and thinking and I am going. I was sure. I know. I told him I was leaving on the 15th. Caller: But I, you know, maybe I am just thinking for common sense would tell you, well, if you are going to leave on the 15th. Caller: When they just cut it off and I had already paid the Bill. Caller: And that is what I do not understand is how high it was too what what they are saying. Caller: But it is OK because I got the, you know. Caller: The. Caller: Check you know that I sent them. Caller: So you know, I had no problem showing that and all that. Caller: That you know I. Caller: I was sure, I told him. Caller: To turn it off, you know that you know, on the 15th I was leaving. Agent: Mm-. Caller: There is nobody there and I go like, what am I going to do? With no equipment? You can not watch TV or do anything. Agent: I see. OK, let me see. Agent: All right. So it looks like you pretty much just need a month Credit adjustment? Agent: Alright, so I am going to do that. Caller: I appreciate that, sir. Agent: Absolutely, and I am going to close it so there will not be any future charges. Caller: I appreciate that right now, as tight as things are by moving over here. Caller: You know I do not mean to cry or snibble that my mom passed away about 6 months ago now. Caller: And to top it off, I ended up going in the hospital, have open Heart surgery. Caller: So I was kind of stuck in the middle of everything, you know, and I could not afford for him before I was living at and that is the only reason I left. Otherwise I would still be over there. But I could not afford what we were me and my mom were at, you know, I taken care of her for about The Last 1518 years, something like that. Caller: And . Caller: You know, as I said, I would rather just pay it, you know, and all that instead of like so many people, they run away from their bills or think they are not going to catch them or something like, well, I do not know, I am just going to pay it. Caller: Get it over with not having nothing following me. Caller: But I appreciate what you are doing there, you know, I do not mean to tell you a SAD story, but it is the truth. Agent: yeah, that sounds pretty Crazy. Caller: Yeah, having and thank God my mom was not here then. She had already gone to Heaven. So I. Caller: She had given her a Heart Attack for me when I found out that is what they were going to do with me. Agent: Why did they have to do that? Caller: shit, they took the veins out of my leg. Agent: . Caller: Or I guess I do not know if the veins were collapsing or, you know, I can not understand everything the way, you know, all the proper words they use and all that. I just know, you know. Caller: I mean, I got scars to show. Caller: At least now I do. Caller: But yeah, it is just, you know, I guess the veins to the valves and all that stuff. Agent: Mm-. Mm-. Caller: Thus my understanding. Caller: You know, otherwise they want to pull all these veins out of my leg. My leg was more painful than it was the dang surgery itself. I mean, I could feel the pain there, but my leg was Killing me. Caller: 'Cause when they take all that stuff up, shoot, I look like hamburger meat. Agent: Wow. Caller: It is a pretty rough, pretty rough thing to go through. I would like to have it my girlfriend there with me. Agent: It is Crazy. Caller: Yeah, life presents things the weirdest way. Caller: But anyway, it is like I say, I try to keep myself up by paying the Bill and all that and then having them message me, you know, that I owe this or, you know, this was not close to that. And I was like, dang, I took care of all that. Caller: Took it in early and everything. Caller: Things happen and it does. Agent: That is true. Let me see here and you said you returned it on the 15th, right? August. Caller: Yes, well, this was September. Agent: OK. Caller: 20 september. See i. I am even getting mixed. Yes, it was in August. Agent: OK, Perfect. Agent: Alright, Perfect. Done. All right Mister Garcia. So I close the account and I backdated it a month ago so it will clear out the balance. Caller: , thank you, sir. I appreciate that. Agent: Absolutely Hope you get better. Caller: Yeah, well, it is a Long process and when I this is home, when I said talk to my girlfriend is her uncles and they would not tell me because I told him, you know, I mean they knew what I went through, you know. And he says, no, that is not going to heal him. 34 months it says going to take you almost a year. Caller: And now I understand what they are talking about. Caller: Because it is not so much that you hear on the outside, it is the inside where they opened you up and that has got to reheal on the inside. That is the part that is painful. Caller: That is I still still have pain in there, you know, and it is all because the insight has to heal, has to get like mended together, whatever happens inside there. Caller: You know. Agent: Crazy. Caller: Yeah, tell me about it. I thought I would be like, you know, sit and it closed me up and it would be over the Hell most. I have had my moments. I can not sleep on my left side just for that reason. The right side seems to be doing OK still, you know, a little painful, but the left, I guess probably that is for the for the Hearts at you know, but dance taking a Long time for it. Caller: To not be hurting so much. Agent: Wow, that is Crazy. Caller: Yeah. Agent: Yeah, Health is a thing. Yeah. Caller: Yeah, well, I am 75 too, so I guess it was time or, you know, things like this you got to go through as you get older. Agent: True. Agent: Well, you sound like you will come through easy so. Caller: Yeah, thank God. Agent: But as far as everything else goes? Agent: You are all set, Mister Garcia. Agent: Absolutely. It has been a pleasure. Caller: OK, Hi. Thank you very much for helping me out here and everything, you know, I just wanted to get it even and everything, you know, it is like I say, I am going to run away from no Bill. That is why I paid it and all that. And. Caller: When I heard this other One I am. Caller: You know, you know, it is like positive, I told him, you know, hey, you know, turn into some leaving on the 15th. Caller: Pretty sure I you know, of course my head might have been screwed up too, I do not know. So I had to do this. Caller: You know, luckily my son has been asking me to come Move over here with him, so that is where I am. Agent: Nice. Well, , also out of Curiosity, what type of provider is in Arizona? The name of the Company? I am just curious. Caller: You know what II do not know because I I have told him over here. Caller: The way they have it setup, it is on the. Caller: I always forget the name of that thing, the thing that I got The Last over there that I had only for about maybe 6456 months. Caller: You know, because I switched them from. Agent: Is this starling? Caller: I switched from cable to that. Agent: , OK. Caller: With you guys, you know, and it did come out cheaper and better for me and everything and I really liked it but. Caller: That is all they do is they use that and it is they are providers like crap. It aint nothing like over there. Caller: Hey, come on ahead, I told me. I will just put it on the spectrum, you know? Caller: So that I put it in my name. I do not care. Caller: So it is better than what they have. Caller: You know. Caller: 'Cause II liked it. I mean, you know, like I say, I like my spectrum and all that. Caller: But they do not have it here. Agent: True. That is true. Agent: Yeah, but . Agent: Yeah, best of luck with everything, Miss Garcia. Caller: Yeah, well, I knew the name of the the thing or, or how they get it and all that. Caller: I should look at maybe One of their bills One of these Days ago, how that Works. Agent: Yeah. Caller: 'Cause they say see, we can. I can not see my brooms, I can not see my Rams, I can not see none of the regular, you know, my regular stuff that I watch in sports. Because over here it is nothing but Arizona. And even at that, they make you pay for everything. I was like, damn, we did not have to back home, man. Caller: You know. Agent: True. Caller: All you do is clear your flat rate for your sports, you know, and it is taken care of. You watch all your Games. Agent: Yeah, yeah, that is what happens when you Move sometimes. Caller: Yeah, kinda sucks. Caller: It is a normal Games. Caller: Shoot, I do not care what the Cardinals and them are doing. Caller: Even though they are. Caller: And I have my son and his friend. They are always, you know, and I shoot traitors, man. You guys are Rams. Caller: Anyway. Agent: Yeah, my mother is a Giants fan, so. Agent: I am originally from New York. Caller: Yeah, no. Caller: yeah, All right. You guys got some good teams out that way. Agent: Yeah, that is true. Agent: But yeah, other than that though, Mister Garcia, , I am going to let you go. Agent: No problem, you take it. Caller: OK II appreciate your help and everything I really do. I hate things like this hanging over my head. I thought I got took care of everything the right way. Agent: no, you are Fine. You are set now. Agent: Alright, you take it easy. Caller: OK, well I thank you for everything. Agent: No problem, you have a good One. Bye. Caller: OK, you too. Thank you.

Agent: You get the service for just $10 and then we would just add the cost of it into that promotion which is $11 a month. Agent: So that would be 21 a month. Caller: . Agent: And after the year will be about 41 a month which is still a lot less than what she is paying now. And she can upgrade her phone at anytime as well. She gets the Limited plus plan so that is the anytime upgrade. Do you all do any International calling or traveling? Caller: Hold on for a minute, so if I get The New phone that you just mentioned, send me the upgrade. Caller: It is going to be. Caller: 40 is going to be for a year. It is going to be 4. How much is the phone period? Agent: Let me get that pulled up here as we break it down for 36 months. You can pay it off now or if you want to just add the cost of it into the plan, it is $11.11. Agent: And if you multiply that by 36 months, which is 36 payments, the phone is about $400.00. Agent: We do have financing options. We just break it down monthly with the service for the year at 10:00 dollars and the cost of the device is 2111 the first year and after that it will be 41. Caller: She read the paper. She would rather buy her own phone then. Caller: But but but we but we will but we can switch over for the for the Price though. Agent: Yes, since the Limited time offer is best to do it now. Was she just looking online to see what phone she wanted specifically? Agent: Yeah, she would just pay. She would just pay the tax on it today, but she can keep the same phone number too. And then we ship it out to you. , we will see within 2 to 5 Days. Caller: So so see this switched her number over and got her own phone. How much? How much would you charge her for the for for a phone line? Agent: $10 for the year, and then she will just add the cost of the phone into it, which is $11.11. Let me see how much it would be today. I am going to pull up that mobile side real quick, OK? Caller: You do not. You do not want to do it. Caller: She do not want to do it. I am not going to send you to it. Agent: OK. I mean, she can keep the same phone right now and then she can upgrade it at anytime. She gets it free anytime upgrade. So the service would just be $10.00. So that would be a better option. Then she can upgrade it when she is ready and give her more time to look at the phone to see which One she wants to go with specifically. But at least for the year, it will just be $10 and she can keep the same phone. Caller: Did you hear that? Agent: She has and she has time to try it out. We have a 14 day trial so. Caller: Pay $10 up to a whole year. Caller: You are saving $30 a month for for for a whole 12 months. Caller: Res. Agent: And she gets a anytime upgrade whenever she is ready. She can get the phone of her choices. She does not have to Rush it. Today, I will give her plenty of time to look over the phones online and then she can let us know when she is ready. Caller: You are going to be saving $30.00. Caller: You are only going to be paying 10 just for switching over for a whole year. Agent: Yeah, that is going to savor over $360.00, which is almost just about the cost of the phone in general. But she does not have to Rush the phone right now. She can just keep the same phone and she will get it anytime. Upgrade when she is ready, she can choose the phone of her choice. Caller: Branch number over and everything be the same and you got to go nowhere to go get it switched over or not. Agent: Yeah, we just, we just get her a SIM card for her phone and she can keep the same phone number. And then whenever she is ready to upgrade her phone, she can look online and she will just let us know and then we can do that for her. Agent: That is a better option. Caller: They prevented. She is listening to you. Caller: No. Agent: Yeah, that is I just did this for myself. I am like, hey, I have had the same phone for a while. I was able to upgrade it as well. I got that same phone, the Galaxy 836. Agent: Since I do Android phones too, which are a lot easier to pair with my tablet that I have. Agent: Yeah, it would just be the tax that would be due today. I am going to let you know how or actually, if she brings her own phone over, she will not have to pay tax or anything. I am going to see if her phone is compatible.

We would prefer not to provide this information. You May only qualify for to bring your own device line. Agent: So we just need your social so we can get this phone approved. Caller: What happened? Agent: Do you mean only qualify for 2? Bring your own device O over with spectrum. Caller: OK. Agent: But we are going to find out the phone. This is not going to be a hard Credit check. This is just a soft Credit check. So we can get your approved for this new phone through Spectrum, but it is not going to hit your Credit or anything. Caller: Alright, go ahead. Caller: What do you want me to do? Agent: Alright, go ahead with your social when you are ready. Caller: No, I got to give you my soap, my whole Social Security number. Agent: Yeah, everything is secure for Security purposes. This is just so we can get her the phone and get her approved for her, even though it is not going to hit your Credit or anything, is it? Just do spectrum separately so we can see what we can get for both of you. Agent: For the actual device. Caller: And that is the only way. Caller: That I can do it is by giving my social Security number over the phone. Agent: Yeah, it is secure. I promise you, Curtis, I have to do that with mine too. Everything is safe and secure, but yes. Caller: Not nothing to do with you, I am just tired. Agent: You are Fine. I know what you mean'cause you want it to be secure, It is secure and save. All calls are monitored or recorded. I have to make sure I mention that to you. Everything is secure 11 we put it in, we will not be able to see what it is at all. Agent: I am sure when you started the service you already gave it to us. We just have to confirm, make sure that everything matches and we can get it approved for this new phone. Caller: OK, OK, xxx. Agent: OK. Thank you so much for your patience. Agent: And then, Latonya, can you confirm your cell phone number that you will be bringing over, please? Caller: Her cell phone number is 216. Caller: 214. Caller: 3206. Agent: xxxx. Caller: Yes, madam. Agent: Alright, would you like to add insurance to your phone, Latonya? Caller: Yes. Agent: Yes, I. Caller: How much is insurance? Caller: Directo. Agent: The repair and replacement plan starts as low as $5 for the premium is $10.00, but it covers a lot more damages and less on the deductible. It is depends on the cost of the phone but is less than the retail value. Of course, instead of having to pay for a whole new phone in full, so it is best to get started, yes? Caller: It is $10 es 10 months. Agent: Yes. Caller: Extra. Caller: Close movie. Agent: Yes, -. If you see you do not need it at anytime, you can take it off of there. But when it is a new phone, I always recommend at least starting with it initially and then if you need it. Caller: So that will be $20 for the first year? Agent: Yes, -. Caller: Mjm okay. Agent: Plus the cost of the phone which is $11.11 so it will be 30. Caller: En el desde. That covers everything like the screen. It falls in the. Caller: If somebody still. Agent: Yes, exactly. Yeah,'cause that is the premium, yes. So that covers a lot more on the day. Caller: What about is she lube? What about if she lose her phone? Agent: Yeah, it has a replacement on there too. Caller: Buscar. Agent: Should this pay a deductible? But they will let you all know how much it is specifically Easy, just depends on the phone. But it is still going to be less than the retail value. Of course this is going to be. Caller: But they do not take the deductible there up front. Caller: I Wonder what? Agent: No, they do not. , up front, yes, when you get in, when she or if and when she needs a new replacement, yes, they will, which is still less than the retail value of the phone. So it is best to have that on there. Agent: And if you do see you do not need it anytime, you could always just take it off. Caller: So May I ask you this question do are there is customer service in this particular instance better than booths or do you know? Agent: Yeah, it is'cause I actually had to replace mine and I dropped my phone and I cracked the screen, so it was going to be through a shurion me for my phone. , believe I paid. Agent: Think like $80 since I had an Android phone at the same phone that she had which is still Last cuz usually about $400 but it just depends on the phone and the damages specifically. But it is still going to be discounted and less than the retail value of course. I mean if she is. Caller: So you have to like send your phone in or you have to, I mean like, how did how does it replace? Agent: Yes you do, and they will ship you a new phone. Agent: Directly to your service address. Caller: So you do not have a phone up until that time? Agent: Or you can go into the Store and they can do it for you there too. Caller: OK, so you can go in the Store and then get it. Caller: Right away. Agent: Yes, yes. -. Caller: OK, OK. Agent: Yeah, I will be through a Shuri on and they can help you out, OK?

Caller: Sí. Caller: Yeah, yeah. Agent: Yes. You want to do the premium, the warranty, the insurance for the $10 for right now and then she needs just a basic insurance.
