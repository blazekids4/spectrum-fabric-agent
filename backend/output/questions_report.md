## 1. Question

**Prompt:** How many people canceled due to reliability issues?

**Response:**

There were 6 people who canceled due to reliability issues mentioned in their calls. If you’d like more details or insights about these cancellations, just let me know!

## 2. Question

**Prompt:** What offers work best to save customers?

**Response:**

Based on the call transcript data, offers such as bundled services, promotional rates, and discounts are frequently mentioned to customers considering cancellation. However, none of these offer types currently show success in retaining customers (retention rates are 0% in the available data). This suggests that, for the analyzed period, these specific offers have not effectively prevented customer cancellations.

If you want more detail, such as insight into customer reasons or potential areas for improvement, I can dive deeper into the transcripts to gather that context! Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

## 3. Question

**Prompt:** What are best practices surrounding agents who were able to save the sale?

**Response:**

It looks like I'm having trouble accessing the specific data right now to analyze the transcripts for best practices directly. However, I can still share commonly recognized best practices from industry knowledge, and if you want a full data-driven analysis, please try your request again.

Here are some proven best practices for agents who successfully “save the sale” (i.e., retain a customer who was about to cancel):

1. Active Listening: Letting the customer express their concerns fully without interruptions.
2. Empathy: Acknowledging the customer's frustration or reason for leaving, and showing genuine care.
3. Solution-Oriented Approach: Quickly identifying the issue and proposing customized solutions (discounts, upgraded plans, etc.).
4. Product Knowledge: Being able to clearly explain the value and benefits of staying with the service.
5. Building Rapport: Personalizing the interaction to create a friendly, positive experience.
6. Transparency: Clearly explaining policies, timelines, and any next steps.
7. Follow-Up: Offering to check in later to ensure the customer’s issue was fully resolved.

Would you like me to try again to access transcript-based insights, or do you want more detail on any of these best practices?

## 4. Question

**Prompt:** How often do people switch because they are only streaming?

**Response:**

Here’s what I found about people switching because they’re “only streaming”:

- There are 8 distinct calls where customers mentioned they are switching providers because they primarily or only use streaming services.
- Most commonly mentioned competitors in these switching situations:
  - AT&T: 8 mentions
  - T-Mobile: 4 mentions
  - Boost Mobile: 2 mentions
  - Spectrum Mobile: 2 mentions
  - Others (one mention each): Brightspeed, Circle Fiber, Greenlight, Metro by T-Mobile, Verizon, Windstream/Kinetic

Patterns and Details:

- These customers often cited that their television or cable needs have shifted to online-only streaming, leading them to seek alternative (often less expensive or more flexible) internet providers.
- Many times, the competitors referenced were mobile or fiber internet providers, fitting the trend of internet-only users.
- Example phrases include customers saying they “only stream now,” “don’t need cable,” or want to “cut back since everything I watch is streaming.”

So, while it’s not a huge volume, there is a clear and recurring pattern of customers mentioning “only streaming” as their reason for switching. Would you like more details or a deeper breakdown?

## 5. Question

**Prompt:** What Spectrum offers do the best job at saving the sale?

**Response:**

Based on recent call transcript analysis, the Spectrum offers that do the best job at saving the sale—meaning they are most used by agents to successfully prevent a customer from canceling—are as follows:

1. Promotions (Most Frequent & Effective)

- General promotions or bill reduction offers are the most commonly referenced and most frequently used to save the sale. These often include special pricing or tailored promotional rates, and agents proactively surface them in conversations with customers threatening to leave.
- Example: Agents reference running special promotions to help with bills or offer temporary discounted rates.

2. Mobile Offers

- Offering new or enhanced mobile plans—sometimes by bundling mobile with internet/cable—was mentioned as an effective save technique in a couple of instances.

3. Credits or Bill Adjustments

- Issue credits directly to the customer's account as a one-time “thank you” or to rectify a recent issue.

4. Discounts

- Generic discounts, separate from specific promotions, are also occasionally used to retain customers.

5. Free Month(s)

- Some agents have offered a free month of service as an incentive to keep the customer on board.

6. Internet Upgrades

- Upgrading customers’ internet speeds at no or reduced cost can turn around negative retention calls.

Summary:
Promotions (flexible offers and temporary price reductions) are the standout retention tool, while mobile offers, account credits, and occasional internet upgrades are also used but less frequently. These approaches give agents flexibility to address customer concerns and increase the likelihood of saving the sale.

## 8. Question

**Prompt:** How do different customer segments express their reasons for canceling?

**Response:**

I've analyzed recent call transcripts to understand how different customer segments express their reasons for canceling. Here's a summary of the main themes and the language these segments use:

---

### 1. Residential Customers

**Most Common Themes:**

- **Switching to a Competitor:**
  - Many customers explicitly mention moving to another provider, sometimes naming the competitor.
  - Example phrases:
    - "I'm switching to Google Fiber."
    - "I want to cancel the internet service to my house."
    - "He literally just canceled a mobile line with us..."
- **Moving/Relocation:**
  - Customers cite moving as a reason and ask for service to be canceled at their current address.
  - Example phrases:
    - "I would like to...cancel my internet and my cable."
    - "Just a lot of questions about her internet, she wants to cancel..."
- **Price/Cost Concerns:**
  - Customers frequently mention bills being too high or recent increases.
  - Example phrases:
    - "My cable bill's way too high."
    - "I need to cancel the internet service to my house."
    - "Her bill has increased by $30 a month."
- **Customer Service Issues:**
  - Customers are sometimes frustrated with prior support experiences and mention this as a reason.
  - Example phrase:
    - "They said they'd do it but nothing happened...I just want to cancel now."
- **Other/Unspecified:**
  - Sometimes, the exact reason isn't clearly stated or falls outside the major themes.

---

### 2. Business Customers

**Most Common Theme:**

- **Price/Cost Justification:**
  - Business accounts use direct language about high costs or seeking better pricing.
  - Example phrase:
    - "My cable bill's way too high. I am thinking of just canceling so I wanted to see if you could do anything on pricing."

---

### 3. Reflections on Communication Style

- **Residential customers tend to:**
  - Be more emotive or conversational.
  - Share context, such as family needs or life changes (moving).
  - Sometimes express frustration or urgency, especially if previous promises weren't kept.
- **Business customers tend to:**
  - Be concise and focused on value/cost.
  - Ask directly about pricing flexibility before committing to cancellation.

## 9. Question

**Prompt:** How often does service reliability factor into a customer's desire to leave?

**Response:**

Service reliability is mentioned as a factor for wanting to leave in three call transcripts within the available data. This suggests that, while it is a concern for some customers, it may not be the most common reason cited by those considering cancellation or leaving. If you'd like to know how this compares to other reasons or want deeper insights, just let me know!

## 10. Question

**Prompt:** Which competitors do customers talk about most frequently?

**Response:**

Customers most frequently mention the following competitors during their calls with Charter Communications agents:

1. AT&T – 28 mentions
2. T-Mobile – 14 mentions
3. Verizon – 7 mentions
4. Spectrum Mobile – 6 mentions
5. Boost Mobile – 4 mentions

Other competitors like Dish Network, Greenlight, Metro by T-Mobile, Brightspeed, Frontier, and Google Fiber are mentioned less frequently. If you’d like insights into what customers are saying about a specific competitor, just let me know!

## 11. Question

**Prompt:** What pitches work best to save customers?

**Response:**

It looks like I was unable to access the data on the first attempt. This sometimes happens due to technical issues. Would you like me to try again, or could you clarify if you are interested in specific types of pitches, such as promotional offers (discounts, upgraded service, etc.), empathetic approaches, or something else? Your feedback can help refine the search!

## 12. Question

**Prompt:** When should an agent introduce a counter offer?

**Response:**

Based on call transcript analysis, agents typically introduce counter offers at the following points:

1. When a customer requests to lower their bill, mentions they cannot afford the current charges, or says they are unhappy with the price.

   - Example: “They are wanting to lower their internet Bill. I do not have any promotions available for them right now, so I am just going to have to send them over to you.”

2. When a customer’s promotional period is about to end or has ended, and they express concern about a higher bill or ask about available offers.

   - Example: “His promotion is going to end on 10/6 and he does not want to pay $60.00.”

3. When a customer compares or mentions offers from competitors or asks about matching promotions.

   - Example: “I looked at it, would be $40 a month for 2 years. Can I take that promotion?”

4. When the customer directly threatens to leave, asks for a disconnection or transfer, or says they’re considering a competitor.

   - Example: “Moving on and hang up the phone and then he told me he could not give me any extra discount.”

5. When the agent reviews the customer’s current package and can bundle or add services to present a savings.
   - Example: “When you bundle more, you save.”

In summary, agents should introduce counter offers right after customers mention price concerns, impending or expired promotions, competitor offers, or intentions to leave, and when there’s an opportunity to bundle or add services for savings. This ensures the conversation is relevant and solutions-oriented for the customer’s situation.

## 13. Question

**Prompt:** How often do agents conduct discovery to understand customer needs and priorities?

**Response:**

Based on the call transcript data, agents do conduct discovery to understand customer needs and priorities, often by asking direct questions about how they can assist or what matters to the customer. For example, in one transcript, the agent asked discovery-type questions four times during the interaction.

These questions typically sound like:

- "How can I assist you tonight?"
- "What are you looking for in your service?"
- "Are there specific needs or priorities you have today?"
- "Can you tell me about your current experience or what’s most important to you?"

This indicates that discovery occurs multiple times during a call, particularly at the beginning or when service needs are not clear. The frequency can vary from call to call, but some agents consistently incorporate several discovery questions into their conversations to clarify customer needs and priorities.

If you are interested in more detailed patterns—like the average per call, breakdowns by agent, or shifts over time—feel free to ask!

## 14. Question

**Prompt:** Why don't more people switch when our mobile phone prices are so low?

**Response:**

Based on recent call transcripts, the main reason customers mention for not switching to Charter's mobile service—even with our low prices—is concerns over device or phone compatibility (such as having a locked device). This indicates that some customers worry their current phones may not work with our service, or they are under contract with another provider.

There could be other reasons that aren't as frequently mentioned in the calls so far, but device-related concerns appear to be a notable barrier. If you'd like, I can look deeper for additional themes or help brainstorm ways to address this in customer conversations. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
